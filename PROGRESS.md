# Progress

- [x] Merge `test-parallel-finishing` into `main`.
- [x] Switch working tree to `main` and verify status.
- [x] Create and switch to `post-processor-beginnings` from `main`.
- [x] Audit cutter-location, tool-library, and backend integration points.
- [x] Research Duet 3D G-code requirements.
- [x] Add machine-definition schema and Duet 3D post-processor baseline.
- [x] Validate implementation and document remaining integration needs.

## Post-processing follow-up

- [ ] Persist machine definitions and expose machine CRUD endpoints.
- [ ] Define setup/work-coordinate transforms and machine-safe retract behavior.
- [ ] Add explicit CL events for operation identity, coolant, dwell, and tool-change policy.
- [ ] Add Duet configuration validation for `M563` and tool macros.
- [ ] Connect frontend program export and optional Duet upload workflow.
- [x] Move all Duet 3D-specific models and implementation into `post_processing/duet3d/`.
- [x] Remove abstract post-processor base and keep implementation as simple concrete classes.
- [x] Remove spindle direction configuration and assume clockwise operation.
- [x] Move machine validation from Pydantic model methods into Duet post-processing.
- [x] Reset branch commits to `main` while preserving changes as working-tree diff.
- [x] Flatten Duet machine/controller settings and assume implicit spindle plus `G54`.
- [x] Remove configurable `M453` and `G94` emission.
- [x] Add demo script turning saved CL-data JSON into Duet 3D G-code.
- [x] Add shared G-code emitter with axis culling, prefix culling, and `fg` formatting.
